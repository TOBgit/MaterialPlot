# BEANS: Property Chart Plotter

![LOGO](Res/logo.png)

Welcome to the BEANS: Property Chart Plotter.

Property Chart Plotter is graph constructor to generate property charts (or Ashby charts) from an input dataset. It allows convinient and effective comparison and selection of items, for example materials, based on two properties. Such plot is widely application not only for materials science, but in general for situations where things need to be selected based on numerical values. The explanation of this plotter will assume the user case of plotting materials property charts.

Built upon the theory of materials selection developed by Mike Ashby, this plotter has the following highlights:
1. Generation of property charts with material bubbles, family bubbles, lables and selection lines
2. Filtering of imported data
3. Easy regrouping of materials into new families
4. Customizable axes with syntax input
5. Switching between log and linear scale
6. Percise color control of materials and family bubbles
7. Percise font and color control of labels
8. Fully support the .csv data format previously prepared for CES softwares

In the future:
9. Multiplot synchronization


Story behind the scene
The lead developers of this tool are friends from high school. They used to play together in World of Warcarft, leading a guild named 'Times of Beans'. The property chart, with its materials bubbles like beans and family bubble like pods, is unexpectedly reminescent. Not sure if the guild is still alive, but they are more than happy to work together on one project again.
