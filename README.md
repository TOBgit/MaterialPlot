Welcome to the BEANS: Property Chart Plotter.

Property Chart Plotter is a graph constructor to generate property charts (or Ashby charts/plots) from an input dataset. It allows convenient and effective comparison and selection of items, for example, materials, based on two properties. Such a plot is widely applied not only for materials science but in general for situations where things need to be selected based on numerical values. The explanation of this plotter will assume the user case of plotting materials property charts.


## Features
Built upon the theory of materials selection developed by Mike Ashby, this plotter has the following highlights:
1. Generation of property charts with material bubbles, family bubbles, lables and selection lines
2. Selecting and editing imported material data
3. Easy regrouping of materials into new families
4. Customizable axes with syntax input
5. Switching between log and linear scale
6. Percise color control of materials and family bubbles
7. Percise font and color control of labels
8. Full controll of the aspect ratio of the plot
9. Fully support the .csv data format previously prepared for CES softwares
10. User-friendly design of UI and UX

## Example
Refer the screenshot for its current UI and the plot style.

## Instructions
Basic python skill is required to run this tool.
The team is also publishing ready-to-use packages for Windows and Mac at important releases. The latest release with the binary package is v0.2.1.

## Fun fact behind the scene

The lead developers of this tool are friends from high school. They used to play together in World of Warcarft, leading a guild named 'Times of Beans'. The property chart, with its materials bubbles like beans and family bubble-like pods, is unexpectedly reminiscent. While it is unknown if the guild is still alive, the developers are more than happy to work together on one project again. By the way, the developers were playing Mage, Rogue, Warlock, and Warrior. There is no healer on the team. So when they are out for a wild task like this, they can only survive by eating and drinking the mage bread/water provided by the kind Mage :(
